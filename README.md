# Doctor_appointment_chatbot

### Overview

This project focuses on developing a conversational AI-powered chatbot to streamline doctor appointment bookings, pharmacy orders, and urgent care requests. The chatbot utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to enable seamless interactions between patients and healthcare providers.

By integrating Language Translation Models (LLM and Langchain), patients can describe their symptoms in their local language, ensuring accessibility. The chatbot also supports appointment rescheduling through Calendly APIs and CRM integrations. Additionally, AI Agents facilitate urgent care support, while pharmacy APIs optimize medicine recommendations at the best rates. The system prioritizes HIPAA compliance to ensure data privacy and security.
